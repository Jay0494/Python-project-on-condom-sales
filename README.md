# Condom Sales Analysis  

## üìå Project Overview  
In this project, I analyze global condom sales data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about consumer behavior. Using Python and key data science libraries, I explore the dataset, clean and visualize the data, and extract meaningful conclusions. After preparing the data, I exported it as a CSV file and loaded it into Power BI for further visualization and dashboard creation.  

## üìä Dataset Description  
I worked with the **"Rich Global Condom Usage Dataset.csv"**, which contains various attributes related to condom sales worldwide. Some of the key aspects of the dataset include:  
- **Country/Region** ‚Äì The location where sales were recorded.  
- **Sales Volume** ‚Äì The number of condoms sold.  
- **Yearly Trends** ‚Äì How sales are distributed over time.  
- **Demographics** ‚Äì Possible segmentation by age, gender, or other factors.  

## üîç My Thought Process  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Loading and Exploring the Data  
```python
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("Rich_Global_Condom_Usage_Dataset.csv")
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
```
- I started by importing essential libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.  
- I then loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.  
- To make sure I could see all the columns, I adjusted the display settings.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Cleaning the Data  
```python
df.info()
df.dropna(inplace=True)  # Removing missing values if necessary
```
- I checked the data types and looked for missing values.  
- Since missing data can affect analysis, I decided to drop null values to keep the dataset clean.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualizing the Data in Python  
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
sns.histplot(df['Sales_Volume'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title("Distribution of Condom Sales")
plt.show()
```
- I created a histogram to see how sales are distributed.  
- I included a KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) plot to get a smoother representation of the distribution.  
- This helped me understand if there were any extreme values or common sales trends.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Exporting Data for Power BI Visualization  
```python
df.to_csv("Cleaned_Condom_Sales.csv", index=False)
```
- After cleaning and preparing the dataset, I exported it as a CSV file named **"Cleaned_Condom_Sales.csv"**.  
- I then loaded this file into **Power BI** for further visualization and interactive dashboard creation.  
- In Power BI, I created charts and reports to better understand sales trends, regional patterns, and consumer behavior.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Extracting Insights  
After looking at the data and visualizations, here are some key observations:  
- **Sales Distribution**: Some regions have significantly higher sales than others.  
- **Country-wise Trends**: A few countries dominate the market, while others have very low sales.  
- **Seasonality**: Sales may fluctuate based on time of year.  

## üöÄ Next Steps  
There are several ways I could extend this analysis:  
- **Predictive Modeling** ‚Äì Using machine learning to predict future sales.  
- **Demographic Insights** ‚Äì Analyzing which groups buy more and why.(See powerbi file)  
- **Advanced Power BI Dashboards** ‚Äì Adding more interactive elements to visualize patterns effectively(See powerbi file).
